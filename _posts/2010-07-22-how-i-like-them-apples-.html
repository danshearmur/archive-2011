<p>Last weekend I accomplished something, that I have been meaning to do for well over a year, install <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/" rel="nofoloow">Mac OS X</a> on my PC.
I had tried a <a href="http://wiki.osx86project.org/wiki/index.php/Installation_Guides/Existing_Leopard_Method">few</a><a href="http://lifehacker.com/348653/install-os-x-on-your-hackintosh-pc-no-hacking-required">different</a> <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5351485/how-to-build-a-hackintosh-with-snow-leopard-start-to-finish">methods</a> that never really got very far; thank god for tonymacx86 and his post:

<p>Turns out it was easier than installing Windows 7. The two drivers missing under OS X were audio and wireless; for which I used <a href="http://code.google.com/p/voodoohda/">VoodooHDA</a> and the <a href="http://www.ralinktech.com/support.php?s=3">Ralink</a> drivers respectively. All in all it’s been a very pleasant experience.
</p><p>I’ve had quite a lot of differing advice about what’s good and what’s not; so I’m gonna wait before I start shouting about what I like on the platform. 
The one thing I really need to draw attention to is how different the keyboard shortcuts are!</p>
<p>Some choice shortcuts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Command+Arrow Down to open a file or folder in finder</li>
  <li>Command+Backspace to delete a file in finder</li>
  <li>Option+Arrows to navigate words at once in text (think control and arrow key on Windows)</li>
  <li>Command+Shift+Backspace to clear trash can (I miss my shift+del; proper delete!)</li>
</ul>
