<p>Like I said in my <a href="http://danshearmur.posterous.com/how-i-like-them-apples" title="How I like them Apples...">earlier post</a> the main difficulty I'm currently having with Mac OS X is learning all the keyboard shortcuts. The refresh combo Cmd+R I found to be quite a pain. I write an awful lot of HTML for a living and F5 is definitely the key which is gonna some day wear out on my keyboard. Changing my refresh habit would take a lot of work and heartache! </p>
<p>So I figured I'd fix it, which as it turns out is really quite easy with a small <a href="http://www.greasespot.net/" title="Greasemonkey">Greasemonkey</a> script. I uploaded the script to <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/82242">userscripts.org</a> and made an <a href="http://dan.shearmur.co.uk/bindf5/" title="BindF5">information page</a>, (which honestly took me about twice as long as the script itself). Anyhow, someone might find this useful, and it's a good excuse to start filling out my posterous!</p>
