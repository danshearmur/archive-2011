title: Doodling in Canvas

<p>I spent a while this weekend learning some <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/canvas_tutorial" title="Mozilla HTML5 Canvas Tutorial" target="_blank">canvas</a>. I didn't actually learn too much in the way of the canvas API, as I spent the majority of the time trying to get my head around frame by frame rendering and moving bits and pieces. Have a look at what I did:</p>

<p>I think in future I will probably have a good go with <a href="https://github.com/batiste/sprite.js" title="sprite.js" target="_blank">sprite.js</a> that looks like it makes things a lot easier.</p>
