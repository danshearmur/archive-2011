title: Havering Councils refusal to "accept registration forms downloaded from the internet"
published: true
---
<p>I moved house just over a month ago, and somewhere on my to-do list was register to vote from the new address. Having moved from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romford_(UK_Parliament_constituency)">Romford</a> to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hornchurch_and_Upminster_(UK_Parliament_constituency)">Hornchurch and Upminster</a> constituency - both fall under Havering.</p>

<p>So a google search later and I'm greeted by a pretty and useful looking website <a href="http://aboutmyvote.co.uk">aboutmyvote.co.uk</a>, after filling out the form I'm greeted by a nice PDF download which I print sign and post second class straight away. Now all of this was nearly two weeks ago, no panic yet, I figured I was pretty much sorted.</p>

<p><em>How wrong I was!</em></p>

<p>Friday the 16th April I received a letter from Havering Council with a new Electoral registration form with the above note attached (sorry the picture is terrible taken in bad light and quickly on my nexus one). The new form basically takes the exact same information but is laid out a little differently.</p>

<p>So I rushed to fill out the new form and dropped it in to the town hall by hand, just to be sure!</p>

<p>After a little digging around and I found this:</p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.havering.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=621">Havering Council's Website</a> (3rd paragraph)</p>
<blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0.8ex; border-left-width: 1px; border-left-color: #cccccc; border-left-style: solid; padding-left: 1ex;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, sans-serif;">Please note that the London Borough of Havering does not accept registration forms downloaded from the internet. If you would like to register please contact us on the number or email address below.</span></blockquote>

<p>This sucks! If Havering can get away with not accepting these forms then why doesn't aboutmyvote tell you that they will not be accepted! I'm sure I can't be the only person to have experienced this, I really do wonder how many people will be caught out trying to vote at the last minute, <strong>without being informed until the deadline is past!</strong></p>

<p>I should have written this up at the weekend, better late than never!</p>
